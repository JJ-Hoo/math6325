\subsection{Problem 4 - Orin Gotchey}
\subsubsection{Measurable Spaces as a Category}
\begin{definition}{$\sigma{}$-algebras}
Let $X$ be a set.  Let $\Omega$ be any subset of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X\in\Omega_{X}$
    \item For each $E\in\Omega$, $X\backslash E\in\Omega_{X}$
    \item For any index $I: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow\Omega_{X}$, $(\cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}I(n))\in\Omega_{X}$
\end{itemize} $\Omega$ is called a $\sigma$\textit{-algebra} on $X$, the pair $(X,\Omega_{X})$ a \textit{measurable space}, the elements of $\Omega_{X}$ the \textit{measurable subsets} of $X$.  
\end{definition}
It follows immediately that $\varnothing\in\Omega_{X}$, and that $\Omega_{X}$ is closed under countable intersection.\\
\begin{definition}{Measurable Maps}The maps $f: X\rightarrow Y$ between measurable spaces which have the following property: 
\begin{equation*}
    \forall E\subset X: (f(E)\in\Sigma\implies E\in\Omega) 
\end{equation*}
are called \textit{measurable maps} or \textit{measurable functions}.
\end{definition}
Let $\texttt{Meas}$ be the category specified as follows:
\begin{outline}
    \1 Objects are the measurable spaces $(X,\Omega)$
    \1 Morphisms are the measurable functions.
\end{outline}
Then, given any morphism $f: X\rightarrow{}Y$,
\begin{equation*}
    f\circ\texttt{Id}_X = f
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \texttt{Id}_Y\circ{}f = f
\end{equation*}
Associativity follows from the fact that the composition of functions on the underlying sets is associative.\\Given two composable morphisms, say $f: X\rightarrow{}Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow{}Z$, consider the composition $g\circ f: X\rightarrow{}Z$, and let $\gamma\in\Omega_{Z}$.  Then:
\begin{equation*}
    g^{-1}(\gamma) \in \Omega_{Y}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    f^{-1}(g^{-1}(\gamma)) = (g\circ f)^{-1}(\gamma) \in\Omega_{X}
\end{equation*}.
Thus, we have that \texttt{Meas} is a category.

\subsubsection{Enhanced Measurable Spaces}
Let $(X,\Omega_X)$ be a topological space.  Then $\mathcal{P}(X)$ forms a Boolean commutative ring with the operations $\cap$ and $\triangle$ as multiplication and addition, respectively, and of which $\Omega_X$ is a subring.
Define an \textit{enhanced measurable space} as a triple $(X,\Omega_X,N_X)$, where $(X,\Omega_X)$ form a measurable space, and $N_X$ is a $\sigma$-ideal of $\Omega_{X}$ (recall: a $\sigma$-\textit{ideal} is an ideal which is closed under \textit{countable} addition).  A \textit{negligible set} in $X$ is some subset of $N_{X}$.\\The \textit{measurable maps} $f: (X,\Omega_X, N_X)\rightarrow(Y,\Omega_Y,N_Y)$ are maps of sets: $f: X_f\rightarrow{}Y$, where $X_f\subset{}X$, such that $f$ obeys the following conditions (which are verified for the identity maps in the subpoints where $X=Y$):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set $X\backslash{}X_f$ is negligible
\begin{itemize}\item $X=X_{\texttt{Id}_X}$ and $X\backslash{}X_{\texttt{Id}_X}=\varnothing\in{}N_X$, by definition of ideal. \end{itemize}
\item For any $m_{y}\in\Omega_Y$, there exists a set $m_{x}$ such that $f^{-1}(m_y)\triangle{}m_x$ is negligible
\begin{itemize}\item Given $m_{x}$, $\texttt{Id}^{-1}_X(m_x)\triangle{}m_X = m_x\triangle{}m_x = \varnothing\in{}N_X$ \end{itemize}
\item For any $n_y\in N_Y$, the set $f^{-1}(n_y)$ is negligible.
\begin{itemize} \item $\texttt{Id}_X(n_x) = n_x$ \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
We cannot define composition of morphisms strictly as composition of underlying maps, because there is no guarantee, e.g., for two maps between enhanced measurable spaces $f:X\rightarrow{}Y,\,g:Y\rightarrow{}Z$, that $\textit{Im}f\subset{}Y_g$.  Thus, we restrict the domain of the composition to:
\begin{equation*}
     X_{g\circ{}f} := f^{-1}(Y_g)
\end{equation*}.
However, it is clear by inspection that composition of morphisms retains associativity.
Then,
\begin{equation*}
    X\backslash{}X_{g\circ{}f} = X\backslash{}f^{-1}(Y_g) = (f^{-1}(Y\backslash(Y_g)))
\end{equation*}
The negligibility of the above quantity then follows from the definition of $f$.\\
Furthermore, given $m_z\in\Omega_Z$, we have that $(g\circ{}f)^{-1}(m_z) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(m_z))$.  Since $g$ is measurable (\textit{why?}) and since $f$ is presumed to satisfy (2), $g\circ{}f$ satisfies (2).\\(3) is clearly transitive.\\Thus, enhanced measurable spaces and measurable maps form a category.
\subsubsection{Equality Almost Everywhere}
Two parallel morphisms $f,g: (X,\Omega_X, N_X)\rightarrow{}(Y,\Omega_Y,N_Y)$ are "equal almost everywhere" if the set $\{x\in X_f\cap{}X_G : f(x)\neq{}g(x)\}$ is negligible.  Let "$f$ and $g$ are equal almost everywhere" be denoted $f\sim{}g$.  Claim: $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflexivity: A function differs from itself on the empty set ($\varnothing$), which is negligible (see above)
    \item Symmetry: Note that the symbols $f$ and $g$ in the definition of equality almost everywhere are symmetric
    \item Transitivity: If $f\sim{}g$ and $g\sim{}h$ for parallel morphisms $f,g,$ and $h$, then 
    \begin{equation*}
    \{x\in X_f\cap{}X_h:f(x)\neq h(x)\}\subset{}(\{x\in X_f\cap{}X_g: f(x)\neq g(x)\}\cup{}\{x\in{}X_g\cap{}X_h: g(x)\neq{}h(x)\})
    \end{equation*}, and $N$ is closed under countable unions and taking subsets, so the left hand side of the above is negligible.
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, this equivalence relation is compatible with composition.  Assume that there are morphisms $f,f': X\rightarrow{}Y$ and $g,g': Y\rightarrow{}Z$. such that $f\sim{}f'$ and $g\sim{}g'$.  We're interested in the set
\begin{multline*}
    \{ x\in{}X_{g\circ{}f}\cap X_{g'\circ{}f'} : (g\circ{}f)(x)\neq(g'\circ{}f')(x) \} \subset{} \{x\in{}X_f\cap{}X_{f'} : f(x)\neq{}f'(x)\}\\ \cup{}f^{-1}(\{y\in{}Y_g\cap{}Y_g': g(y)\neq{}g'(y)\})
\end{multline*}
This set is the union of two negligible sets.
\subsubsection{Hom-sets mod an Equivalence Relation}
Suppose that for every pair of objects $X,Y$ in a category $C$, we are given (e.g. by the above) an equivalence relation $R_{X,Y}$ on $C(X,Y)$ that is compatible with composition (i.e. if $f\sim_Rf'$ and $g\sim_Rg'$ then $(g\circ{}f)\sim_R(g'\circ{}f')$.  We identify all morphisms in $C$ between any two objects $X$ and $Y$ which relate through $R_{X,Y}$.  Composition of equivalence classes of $\sim{}$ does not depend on choice of representative: this is exactly compatibility with $\circ{}$\\Verifying that the proper morphisms are unital and associative are gifted as simple exercises to the reader ;)



\subsection{Problem 6 - Alan Bohnert}
\subsubsection{Question}
Fix a category \textbf{C}. 
A \textit{bimorphism} in \textbf{C} is a morphism $f$ that is simultaneously a monomorphsim and an epimorphism. Is any isomorphism a bimorphism? 
Give and example of a category \textbf{C} and a bimorphism $f$ in \textbf{C} that is not an isomorphism.

\subsubsection{Solution}
In any category \textbf{C} every isomorphism is a bimorphism.

\begin{proof}
    Let $f:X\xrightarrow{}Y$ be an isomorphism in \textbf{C}. 
    Then there exists a morphism $g:Y\xrightarrow{}X$ in \textbf{C} such that 
    \begin{center}
        $gf=$Id$_X$ and $fg=$Id$_Y$.
    \end{center}
    
    To show $f$ is a monomorphism let $h,k:W \rightrightarrows X$ and $fh=fk$.
    It follows that $gfh=gfk$ for the $g$ given above.
    Therefore Id$_X h=$Id$_X k$ and so $h=k$ tells us $f$ is a monomorphism.
    
    To show $f$ is an epimorphism let $m,n:Y \rightrightarrows Z$ and $mf=nf$.
    Composing with the $g$ we know $mfg=nfg$.
    Consequently $m$Id$_Y=n$Id$_Y$ and $m=n$ tells us $f$ is an epimorphism.
    Therefore $f$ is a bimorphism.
\end{proof}

\vspace{2mm}

\noindent Let \textbf{C} be the category \textbf{Ring} and let $f:\Z \xhookrightarrow[]{} \Q$ the inclusion map.
We claim $f$ is a bimorphism but not an isomorphism.

\begin{proof}
    To show $f$ is a monomorphism let $h,k:W \rightrightarrows \Z$ and $f\circ h(w)=f \circ k (w)$ $\forall w\in W$.
    Since $f$ is injective
    \begin{center}
        $h(w)=f\circ h(w)=f\circ k(w)=k(w)$.
    \end{center}
    Therefore $h(w)=k(w)$ and $f$ is a monomorphism.
    
    To show $f$ is an epimorphism let $m,n:\Q \rightrightarrows S$ such that $m\circ f(x)=n\circ f(x)$ $\forall x\in \Q$.
    Since $f$ is injective, we know $m(z)=n(z)$ $\forall z\in\Z$.
    Seeking a contraction, suppose there exists $\frac{a}{b}\in \Q$ such that $m(\frac{a}{b})\neq n(\frac{a}{b})$.
    Given $m$ and $n$ are ring homomorphisms we know
    \begin{center}
        $m(a)m(b^{-1})=m(\frac{a}{b}) \neq n(\frac{a}{b})=n(a)n(b^{-1})$.
    \end{center}
    Given $b$ is an invertible integer and $m(b)=n(b)$ we can multiply on the right and retain the inequality.
    Thus, 
    \begin{center}
        $m(a)m(b^{-1})m(b)\neq n(a)n(b^{-1})n(b)$
    \end{center} 
    and as ring homomorphisms we have
    \begin{center}
        $m(a)=m(a)m(b^{-1}b)\neq n(a)n(b^{-1}b)=n(a)$.
    \end{center}
    Therefore $f$ is a epimorphism.
    
    To show $f$ is not an isomorphism we note $\frac{1}{3}\in \Q$ has no preimage in $\Z$.
\end{proof}
